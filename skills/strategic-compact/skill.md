# Strategic Compact

## When to Activate
- Session is getting long (>50 exchanges)
- Context window is filling
- Starting a new major feature

---

## Compaction Strategy

1. **Summarize completed work**
   ```
   "We've implemented:
   - UserService trait with CRUD operations
   - JWT authentication middleware
   - PostgreSQL repository with SQLx"
   ```

2. **Identify current state**
   ```
   "Currently working on:
   - OrderService implementation
   - Pending: PaymentService"
   ```

3. **Archive old context**
   ```
   "UserService is complete and tested.
   Reference: src/services/user_service.rs"
   ```

## Session Summary Format

```markdown
